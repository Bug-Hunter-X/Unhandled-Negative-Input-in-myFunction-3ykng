This repository contains a MATLAB function (myFunction.m) that demonstrates an uncommon error: failure to handle negative input values. The function attempts to process input, but it produces unexpected results or crashes when negative inputs are provided. The bugSolution.m file presents a corrected version of the function that effectively handles negative input.
